# Project Title:

### Window Kill Game Simulation - Phase 1 and Phase 2

# Description:

### This project is a simulation of a Window Kill game developed using Java Swing. 
### The project was completed in three phases as part of an advanced programming course. 
### The primary objective was to learn project management, clean coding practices, and improve proficiency in Java Swing and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
### The game involves interactive gameplay where players manage multiple windows and engage in various actions within them.

# Main Features:

### Three Phases of Development: The project was designed and implemented in three distinct phases, focusing on modular design and iterative improvements.
### Multiplayer Gameplay: Simulates interactions between multiple windows with dynamic behaviors.
### OOP Principles: Utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure the game.
### Clean Code: Emphasizes maintainable, readable code with well-structured classes and methods.
### Swing GUI: Custom graphics rendering and handling of window interactions using Java Swing.
### Event Handling: Implements interactive controls and game mechanics using keyboard and mouse inputs.

# Technologies Used:

### Java
### Java Swing for GUI components and game rendering.
### OOP principles for structuring game logic.
### Event listeners for user interactions.
### Modular code for maintainability and extensibility.
